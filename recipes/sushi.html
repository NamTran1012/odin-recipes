    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>It was a really good recipe and pretty easy to do. I also had a lot of fun making these homemade sushi rolls, and my family really enjoyed them as well. I have never made rice before, so the instructions above really helped me. I would  definitely recommend this recipe because it was fun to make, and the food was delicious.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups sushi rice, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup rice vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons black sesame seeds</li>
        <li>Bamboo sushi mat</li>
        <li>8 nori sheets</li>
        <li>1 small cucumber, seeded and julienned</li>
        <li>3 ounces imitation crabmeat sticks, julienned</li>
        <li>1 medium ripe avocado, peeled and julienned</li>
        <li>Optional: Reduced-sodium soy sauce, prepared wasabi and pickled ginger slices</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large saucepan, combine rice and water; let stand for 30 minutes. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until water is absorbed and rice is tender. Remove from the heat. Let stand, covered, for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in small bowl, combine the vinegar, sugar and salt, stirring until sugar is dissolved.</li>
        <li>Transfer rice to a large shallow bowl; drizzle with vinegar mixture. With a wooden paddle or spoon, stir rice with a slicing motion to cool slightly. Cover with a damp cloth to keep moist. (Rice mixture may be made up to 2 hours ahead and stored at room temperature, covered with a damp towel. Do not refrigerate.)</li>
        <li>Sprinkle toasted and black sesame seeds onto a plate; set aside. Place sushi mat on a work surface so mat rolls away from you; line with plastic wrap. Place 3/4 cup rice on plastic. With moistened fingers, press rice into an 8-in. square. Top with 1 nori sheet.</li>
        <li>Arrange a small amount of cucumber, crab and avocado about 1-1/2 in. from bottom edge of nori sheet. Roll up rice mixture over filling, using the bamboo mat to lift and compress the mixture while rolling; remove plastic wrap as you roll.</li>
        <li>Remove mat; roll sushi rolls in sesame seeds. Cover with plastic wrap. Repeat with remaining ingredients to make 8 rolls. Cut each into 8 pieces. Serve with soy sauce, wasabi and ginger slices if desired.</li>
    </ol>
